# Armada-Metaflow Extension Developer / Contributor Guide

## Introduction
This document explains how to setup, run, and test (and optionally contribute to) 
the `@armada` metaflow decorator. Decorating a metaflow step with `@armada` 
causes that step to be executed as an [Armada](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada) job.

## Setting up a Local Sandbox
You'll need a few components deployed and running either locally, or somewhere 
accessible via your network in order to start using and testing the `@armada` 
Metaflow decorator.

Briefly you'll need:
* An Armada instance.
* An S3 provider.
* A local Metaflow installation along with this repository.

We'll go over each of these items below.

### Armada
A fully operational Armada instance can be quickly booted on a local machine by cloning the 
[Armada repository](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada):

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/armadaproject/armada
```
and then following the [Developer Guide](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada/blob/master/docs/developer.md).

Once you have Armada's requirements satisfied, you can run:

```bash
$ mage localDev full
```
from Armada's repository root. This will cause all Armada services and 
necessary dependencies to be booted and deployed via `docker compose` and 
[`kind`](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/).

>[!TIP]
>You will need an Armada queue available in order to run metaflow `@armada` steps. You can create one by running:
>```bash
>$ ~/go/src/github.com/armadaproject/armada/bin/armadactl create queue metaflow
>```
>once Armada is built and running.


### Localstack 
[Localstack](https://www.localstack.cloud/) is necessary to provide an S3 service so that flow steps may store and 
retrieve data. If you have an S3 compatible service already available you may skip setting up localstack and use 
that instead.

A localstack instance can be booted by following their 
[installation guide](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/installation/) and then running:

```bash
$ localstack --profile=all_networks start -d
```
This will start a localstack container running an S3 compatible service (amongst others).

>[!TIP]
>You may want localstack to listen on `0.0.0.0` in order to expose it on a network that flows may reach from 'outside' 
>of Armada as well has jobs launched 'inside' Armada. You will need a file at `~/.localstack/all_networks.env` with the
>following contents:
>```env
>GATEWAY_LISTEN=0.0.0.0:4566
>```
>Which will cause localstack to listen on port `4566` on all interfaces. This is why we added `--profile=all_networks` as an
>option to the invocation of `localstack`.

See [Localstack's Configuration docs](https://docs.localstack.cloud/references/configuration/) for more information.

To create a bucket for use by metaflow you may run:
```shell
$ awslocal s3 mb s3://localstack-metaflow-armada
```

### Metaflow & Armada-Metaflow
In order to use the `@armada` Metaflow decorator/extension you will need to clone [this repository](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada-metaflow):
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/armadaproject/armada-metaflow
$ cd armada-metaflow
$ pip install .
```

`armada-metaflow` provides `metaflow_extensions`, which exposes the armada step
decorator to Metaflow. Accordingly, you will need to have a pip installation 
of `metaflow` locally.

Metaflow must be configured to enable the armada extension, below is an example Metaflow configuration file:

```json
{
    "METAFLOW_DEBUG_EXT": true,
    "METAFLOW_CONSOLE_TRACE_ENABLED": true,
    "METAFLOW_ENABLED_CLI": ["armada"],
    "METAFLOW_ENABLED_STEP_DECORATOR": ["armada"],
    "METAFLOW_S3_ENDPOINT_URL": "http://my.s3service.url:4566",
    "METAFLOW_DEFAULT_DATASTORE": "s3",
    "METAFLOW_DATASTORE_SYSROOT_S3": "s3://localstack-metaflow-armada",
}   
```
Which is typically located at `~/.metaflowconfig/config.json`. This enables the `@armada` step decorator, as well as cli, and points metaflow to our s3 service. Additionally, the configuration above enables some additional debug and tracing output. Replace `http://my.s3service.url:4566` with an appropriate url to reach your desired s3 service.

### Full Example `@armada` Flow

Example scripts utilizing this extension can be found in the (examples)[https://github.com/armadaproject/armada-metaflow/blob/main/examples/] directory.

A full example of using the `@armada` step decorator within a flow is given below:

```python
from metaflow import FlowSpec, step, armada                                                                                     


class ArmadaFlow(FlowSpec):                                                                                                          """A simple flow demonstrating the use of Armada with Metaflow."""

    @step
    def start(self):                                                                                                                   """Sets a local variable."""
        print("Start")                                                                                                                 self.local_var = 214 
        print(f"Set self.local_var: {self.local_var}")
        self.next(self.submit_job_decorated) 
        
    @armada(
        host="localhost",
        port="50051",
        logging_host="localhost",
        logging_port="50053",
        queue="test",
        job_set_id="job-set-alpha",
        cpu="240m",
        memory="2Gi",
        insecure_no_ssl=True,
    )                                              
    @step
    def submit_job_decorated(self):
        """Sets a variable within Armada and demonstrates access to data
        from previous steps."""
        print("Hello world from an Armada-launched container!")
        self.armada_var = 1337                                                                                         
        print(f"armada_var: {self.armada_var} local_var: {self.local_var}")
        self.next(self.end)
        
    @step
    def end(self):
        """Ends the flow and shows that the variable set within Armada is
        available outside."""
        print(f"Armada container variable retrieved outside: {self.armada_var}")
        print(f"local_var: {self.local_var}")                                  
        print("End")


if __name__ == "__main__":                                           
    ArmadaFlow()                
```

You can run this example by saving the above to a file, say `armada.py` and running:
```bash
$ python armada.py run
```
If everything is successful you'll see output similar to the following:
```

## Still TODO

* Support storage backends other than S3.
* And more...
